# Disclaimer

This project is still in very early development, and is currently meant to serve as a proof of concept. It is not recommended to use this in production.

# Getting Started

Marz is built on top of [Bun](https://bun.sh/), so you'll need to install that first by following their [installation guide](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).

Then use `bun create marz` to use the interactive [create-marz](https://github.com/hex2f/marz/tree/main/packages/create-marz) CLI.

To run the server, use `bun dev`. This bundles all of your pages and components, and starts a server on port 3000.

Routing is determined by the file structure of your `pages` directory. For example, a file at `pages/index.tsx` will be served at `/`, and a file at `pages/about.tsx` will be served at `/about`. Each file is expected to export a named `Page` component. For now, all `Page` components must be server components, but they can import and use client components. Params are supported (`pages/[id].tsx` or `pages/[id]/about.tsx`), and can be accessed via the `params` prop on the `Page` component.

# Contributing
